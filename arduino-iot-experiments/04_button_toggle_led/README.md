# Button Toggle LED

This project demonstrates: controlling an LED using a push button.

# Requirements
Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
Push button
LED
220Ω resistor
10kΩ resistor (pull-down)
Breadboard and jumper wires
USB cable for programming
Arduino IDE

# Procedure
Connect the button to digital pin 2 and configure as input with pull-down
Connect LED to pin 8 through 220Ω resistor
Open Arduino IDE
Understand the Code
Upload the Code and press the button

# Observations
Pressing the button turns the LED ON. Releasing it turns the LED OFF.
