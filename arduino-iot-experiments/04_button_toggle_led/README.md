# Button Toggle LED

This project demonstrates: controlling an LED using a push button.

# Requirements
Arduino Uno R4 WiFi,
Push button,
LED,
220Ω resistor,
10kΩ resistor (pull-down),
Breadboard and jumper wires,
USB cable for programming,
Arduino IDE.

# Procedure
1. Connect the button to digital pin 2 and configure as input with pull-down
2. Connect LED to pin 8 through 220Ω resistor
3. Open Arduino IDE
4. Understand the Code
5. Upload the Code and press the button

# Observations
Pressing the button turns the LED ON. Releasing it turns the LED OFF.
