# LCD Light Sensor Display

This project demonstrates: reading sensor data (e.g. light) and showing it on LCD.

# Requirements
Arduino Uno R4 WiFi,
Light sensor (e.g. VEML7700),
16x2 LCD (I2C or parallel),
Breadboard and jumper wires,
USB cable for programming,
Arduino IDE

# Procedure
1. Connect the sensor to I2C pins and LCD to I2C or digital pins
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Understand the Code
4. Upload the Code
5. Observe the Output on LCD

# Observations
The sensor reading (like light intensity in lux) is continuously displayed on the LCD.
