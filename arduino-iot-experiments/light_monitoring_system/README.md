# Light Monitoring System

This project uses the RTC to take the sensor readings at specific intervals (like 5 sec/10 sec/etc). The keypad allows the user to change the interval. The interval when any key is pressed can be calculated using the formula: 5 x (key pressed). For e.g, if the key pressed is 3, then the sensor readings will be taken at every 15 seconds.
