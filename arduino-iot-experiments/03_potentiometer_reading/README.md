# Potentiometer Reading
This project demonstrates: reading analog values from a potentiometer.

# Requirements
1) Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
2) Potentiometer
3) Breadboard and jumper wires
4) USB cable for programming
5) Arduino IDE

# Procedure
1) Connect the potentiometer middle pin to A0, side pins to 5V and GND
2) Open Arduino IDE. Understand and Upload the Code.
3) Observe the Output on Serial Monitor

# Observations
The analog value varies between 0V and 5V as the potentiometer is rotated.
