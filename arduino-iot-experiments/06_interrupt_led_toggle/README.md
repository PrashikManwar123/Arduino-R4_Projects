# Interrupt LED Toggle

This project demonstrates: using external interrupts to control an LED.

# Requirements
Arduino Uno R4 WiFi,
Push button,
LED,
220Î© resistor,
Breadboard and jumper wires,
USB cable for programming,
Arduino IDE.

# Procedure
1. Connect button to pin 2 (interrupt pin), LED to pin 8
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Understand the Code (attachInterrupt function)
4. Upload the Code
5. Press the button and observe the LED
   
# Observations
Pressing the button triggers an interrupt and turns ON the LED.
