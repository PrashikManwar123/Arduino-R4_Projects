# Potentiometer LED Control
This project demonstrates: controlling LED brightness using a potentiometer (PWM).

# Requirements
Arduino Uno R4 WiFi,
Potentiometer,
LED,
220Î© resistor,
Breadboard and jumper wires,
USB cable for programming,
Arduino IDE.

# Procedure
1. Connect potentiometer to A0, LED to PWM pin 9 with resistor
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Understand the Code
4. Upload the Code
5. Observe the Output

# Observations
As the potentiometer is rotated, the LED brightness changes smoothly.
