# LED Blink External

This project demonstrates: blinking an external LED connected to Arduino.

# Requirements
1) Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
2) Breadboard and jumper wires
3) 220Ω resistor
4) LED
5) USB cable for programming
6) Arduino IDE

# Procedure
1) Connect the LED anode to digital pin 8 through a 220Ω resistor, and cathode to GND
2) Open Arduino IDE
3) Understand the Code
4) Upload the Code
5) Observe the Output

# Observations
The external LED connected to pin 8 toggles ON and OFF every 1 second.
