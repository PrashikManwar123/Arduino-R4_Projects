# Using RTC with LCD to make a Clock

This project uses an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module with an LCD display to build a simple digital clock. The clock continuously displays the current date and time retrieved from the RTC module.

# Requirements
Arduino Uno R4 WiFi,
DS3231 RTC Module,
16x2 LCD (I2C or parallel),
Breadboard and jumper wires,
USB cable for programming,
Arduino IDE.

# Procedure
1. Connect RTC module and LCD to Arduino via I2C
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Understand the Code
4. Update the required values of current date, time, etc. in the code
5. Upload the Code
6. Observe the Output on LCD

# Observations
The current time and date are shown on the LCD and update every second.
